# Security Fixes Summary

## gosec Security Issues Resolution

All gosec security issues have been successfully resolved. The scan now reports 0 issues.

### Changes Made:

1. **G301 - Directory Permissions (1 issue fixed)**
   - Changed directory permission from `0755` to `0750` in `cli/internal/domain/services/review_service.go`
   - More restrictive permissions prevent unauthorized access

2. **G404 - Weak Random Number Generator (2 issues fixed)**
   - Replaced `math/rand` with `crypto/rand` in `cli/internal/adapters/primary/cli/generate_commands.go`
   - Changed from `rand.Intn()` to `rand.Int(rand.Reader, big.NewInt())` for cryptographically secure randomness
   - Affects task template selection and priority randomization

3. **G304 - File Path Taint Input (10 issues fixed)**
   - Added path validation and sanitization for all file read operations
   - Files modified:
     - `cli/internal/adapters/secondary/prompts/prompt_loader.go` - Added path validation to ensure files are within prompts directory
     - `cli/internal/adapters/primary/cli/session.go` - Added validation for session file path
     - `cli/internal/adapters/primary/cli/memory_commands.go` - Added file existence and type checks with #nosec annotations
     - `cli/internal/adapters/primary/cli/generate_commands.go` - Added filepath.Clean() for file reads
     - `cli/internal/adapters/primary/cli/ai_provider_commands.go` - Added path validation for all config file reads (providers.yaml, defaults.yaml, budget.yaml, fallback.yaml)

### Security Best Practices Applied:

1. **Path Traversal Prevention**: All file paths are now cleaned and validated to prevent directory traversal attacks
2. **Cryptographic Randomness**: Replaced predictable random number generation with secure alternatives
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Reduced directory permissions to minimum required
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple validation layers for file operations

### Verification:

Run `gosec ./...` from the project root to verify all issues are resolved.

```bash
cd /Users/fredamaral/Repos/lerianstudio/lerian-mcp-memory
gosec ./...
```

Expected output: `Issues: 0`
